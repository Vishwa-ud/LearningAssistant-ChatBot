    "I chose `mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_K_M.gguf` for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Open-source and free to use — avoids costs associated with closed LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT)\n",
    "- ✅ Lightweight quantized model (`Q4_K_M`) suitable for local inference\n",
    "- ✅ Instruction-tuned, making it better at following prompts and engaging in QA\n",
    "- ✅ Good performance for academic-level questions with reasonable context\n",

    "\"\"\"\n",
    "I adopted the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🔍 It grounds the language model's output on course-specific content (e.g., CTSE slides/notes)\n",
    "- 📚 Makes answers more factual, reduces hallucinations\n",
    "- 🔁 Supports document updates without fine-tuning the model\n",
    "- 🧠 Embedding + vector search ensures semantic similarity, not just keyword matches\n",
    "\n",
    "For UI, I used **Chainlit** because:\n",
    "- 🧪 Interactive chat interface optimized for LLM workflows\n",
    "- 📂 Supports file upload (PDF, PPTX) easily\n",
    "- 🧰 Seamless integration with Python-based backends (LLM + RAG)\n",
