# 🤖 LearningAssistant- CHATBOT

**LearningAssistant** is a smart chatbot powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) that allows students to ask questions based on CTSE (Computer Technology and Software Engineering) lecture notes. This project was developed as part of an AI/ML Semester 1 (2025) assignment to demonstrate how LLMs can support education by answering subject-specific queries inside a Jupyter Notebook.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **🎯 Objective**: Build a chatbot that can answer CTSE lecture note-based questions using LLMs.
- **🧠 Focus**: Natural language understanding and context-aware response generation.
- **💻 Environment**: Implemented entirely inside a Jupyter Notebook for interactivity and easy experimentation.
- **📚 Input**: CTSE lecture notes (text format).
- **🔍 Output**: Answers to user questions based on those notes.

## 🚀 Features

- 📘 Ask context-rich questions about CTSE topics.
- 🧠 Powered by a pre-trained LLM (e.g., GPT or Hugging Face model).
- 📎 Context-aware responses from provided notes.
- 🧩 Easy to extend with additional subjects or notes.
- 🎓 Ideal for exam prep, concept clarification, and learning assistance.
