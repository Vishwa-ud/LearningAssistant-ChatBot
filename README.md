# LearningAssistant-ChatBot
An interactive chatbot powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) that helps students ask and explore questions based on CTSE (Computer Technology and Software Engineering) lecture notes. This project is implemented inside a Jupyter Notebook and demonstrates how LLMs can be fine-tuned or prompted to act as intelligent learning companions.
